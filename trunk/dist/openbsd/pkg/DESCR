Zat is a portable, table driven, single pass assembler written in C++. It works
with external syntax definition tables which makes it suitable (and easily
configurable) for use with any assembly-style language and dialect. Zat is
considerably fast, translating around 4500 lines of source code per second. When
it comes to labels and expressions, zat imposes as little restrictions as
possible: all symbols, including the ones that define the base address of a
block of code (the origin) are evaluated after all source code has been
processed and the machine code has been emitted.

Zat does not support macros at this time.
